InvFind, a scanner for some of Ontario's worst invasive species!
Created by Andrew Wang, Connor Byers, Molly Yu, Nick Makharinets.

Welcome to InvFind! This project has not been deployed yet so we'll walk you through the web app. This is a project built
using Flask, and the image recognition technology built using the Python Tensorflow Library. Essentially, we are using
Tensorflow to train our image-recognition neural network to distinguish between invasive and native species to the province of
Ontario, Canada. 

The model uses around 3000 images scraped off of the internet of the top eight most invasive species in Ontario. The website was made to integrate the Tensorflow Neural Network with the Flask back-end logic and send the appropriate responses to the client.
